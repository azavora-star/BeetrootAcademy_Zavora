# Exercise 5: Movie Database
# Create a Movie class that represents a movie in a movie database. 
# The class should have various fields to store information about the movie, 
# such as its title, director, genre, release year, duration, and ratings. 
# Use public, private, and protected access modifiers appropriately. 
# Implement methods to update movie details, calculate average ratings, and display movie information.
